Make plate preparation for ScreenSeq more intuitive.

Background
----------

This tool was created as a visual aid to preparing barcode plates for ScreenSeq. Creating barcode plates from master barcode maps can be tedious and error prone, because each map adheres to a different *rule* (e.g., offset second row by one and combine with first row). This tool takes out the mental exercise of figuring out which barcode rows must be combined into which plate row. 

Usage
-----



```{bash}
git clone  
```
